# dot-pool-selector
Select the best nomination pools algorithmically

## Criteria
The algorithm selects pools based on the following:

- The root user is verified
- The root user has skin in the game 
- The pool's validators meet general standards, see more [here](https://github.com/James-Sangalli/dot-validator-selector#criteria)
- The pool is in an open state 
- The pool has not reached the max member count 
- The pool has selected an optimal number of validators
